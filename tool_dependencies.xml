                    The Genome Analysis Toolkit or GATK is a software package for analysis of high-throughput sequencing data,
                    developed by the Data Science and Data Engineering group at the Broad Institute.

                    The toolkit offers a wide variety of tools, with a primary focus on variant discovery and
                    genotyping as well as strong emphasis on data quality assurance.
                    Its robust architecture, powerful processing engine and high-performance computing features make it
                    capable of taking on projects of any size.
